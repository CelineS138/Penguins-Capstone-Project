## Consistency in Hockey

How do we define a consistent player?

**Initial thoughts to be investigated;**

-   Consistent goalies, defense men, forward men or what combinations of consistency make an optimal outcome

-   Are these combinations team specific? How do we find optimal combinations.

    ### Understanding Hockey Data or what kind of data to use:

    -   Play by play

    -   Team data or player data

    -   Metrics to look at:

        -   means, variances within a season of valueble performance
        -   Need to define valuable perfomance based on player type i.e goalie, forward or defense man
